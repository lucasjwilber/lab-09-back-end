## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app will take user location inquiry and output useful travel information for that location, by making several API calls and handing that data to the front end.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Create basic server with all packages installed (express, dotenv, cors)
2. Create an account on google maps and get an API key.
3. Use https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/ as your front-end.
